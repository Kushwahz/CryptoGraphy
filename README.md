# CryptoGraphy

###### Timeline | 2015-16 (Engineering - 2nd Year)

Demonstrating a cryptographic technique using an android app. It represents the process of encryption/decription where an user enters a plain text message followed by its hash key which then undergoes encryption and the app produces the Cipher text. Later user can also decrypt the same Cipher text to the original text message. This cryptographic demonstration is used to practice and exhibit the android UI components and other concerned features. It doesn't implement the actual underlying encrytion/decryption formulae.
